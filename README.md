Automatically classify genetic mutations/variations using ML, to help in cancer treatment.
<br>
Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).
Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations/variations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.

We need to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
