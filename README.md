# Medical Treatment using Classification
<i>Automatically classify genetic mutations/variations using ML, to help in cancer treatment.</i>
<br><br>
Once sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations (passengers).<br>
Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations/variations is being done manually. This is a very time-consuming task where a clinical pathologist has to manually review and classify every single genetic mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
<br><br>
We need to develop a Machine Learning algorithm that, using this knowledge base as a baseline, automatically classifies genetic variations.
